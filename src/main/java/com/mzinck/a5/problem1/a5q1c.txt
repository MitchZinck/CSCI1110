For timing the programs I took each program and made it run over and over adding 10 words everytime to the input.
With this I found that Collections.sort resulted in a much faster runtime.

The times are as follows:

a5q1 lines | a5q1b lines | Time

10          10000              1s
500          500000             5s
2000         1000000             10s
8000         2000000            20s
